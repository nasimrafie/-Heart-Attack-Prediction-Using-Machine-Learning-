# -Heart Attack Prediction Using Machine Learning
I developed a machine learning project to predict heart attack risk based on key health metrics like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type, and ECG results. Using data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection, I built and evaluated ML models to classify individuals as at risk or normal.
